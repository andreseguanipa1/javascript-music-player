    lyrics: `First things first
    I'ma say all the words inside my head
    I'm fired up and tired of the way
    That things have been, oh-ooh
    The way that things have been, oh-ooh
    Second things second
    Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
    I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
    The master of my sea, oh-ooh. <br /><br />
    
    I was broken from a young age
    Taking my sulking to the masses
    Writing my poems for the few
    That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
    Singing from heartache from the pain
    Taking my message from the veins
    Speaking my lesson from the brain
    Seeing the beauty through the <br /><br />
    
    Pain!<br />
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    Pain!<br />
    You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
    Pain!<br />
    Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from
    Pain!<br />
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer. <br /><br />
    
    Third things third
    Send a prayer to the ones up above
    All the hate that you've heard
    Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
    Your spirit up above, oh-ooh. <br /><br />
    
    I was choking in the crowd
    Building my rain up in the cloud
    Falling like ashes to the ground
    Hoping my feelings, they would drown
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
    Inhibited, limited
    Till it broke open and rained down
    And rained down, like <br /><br />
    
    Pain!<br />
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    Pain!<br />
    You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
    Pain!<br />
    Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from
    Pain!<br />
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br /><br />
    
    Last things last
    By the grace of the fire and the flames
    You're the face of the future
    The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
    The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
    Inhibited, limited
    Till it broke open and rained down
    And rained down, like <br /><br />
    
    Pain!<br />
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    Pain!<br />
    You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
    Pain!<br />
    Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from
    Pain!<br />
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br /><br />

    lyrics: `
    Days pass by and my eyes, they dry
    And I think that I'm okay<br />
    'Till I find myself in conversation fading away <br /><br />

    The way you smile, the way you walk
    The time you took to teach me
    All that you had taught<br />
    Tell me, how am I supposed to move on? <br /><br />

    These days, I'm becoming everything that I hate
    Wishing you were around
    But now it's too late
    My mind is a place that
    I can't escape your ghost <br /><br />

    Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
    One more rainy day without you<br />
    Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
    One more rainy day <br /><br />

    Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
    Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
    I've tried to put this all behind me
    I think I was wrecked all along
    Yeah, I'm a wreck <br /><br />

    They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away<br />
    But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
    The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
    The time you took to teach me all that you had taught<br />
    Tell me, how am I supposed to move on? <br /><br />

    These days, I'm becoming everything that I hate
    Wishing you were around
    But now it's too late
    My mind is a place that
    I can't escape your ghost <br /><br />

    Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
    One more rainy day without you<br />
    Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
    One more rainy day <br /><br />

    Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
    Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
    I've tried to put this all behind me<br />
    I think I was wrecked all along <br /><br />

    These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
    I remember the words that you said
    Remember the life you led <br /><br />

    You'd say: Oh, suck it all up
    Don't get stuck in the mud
    Thinking of things that you should have done
    I'll see you again, my loved one <br /><br />

    I'll see you again, my loved one
    Yeah, I'm a wreck
    I'll see you again, my loved one <br /><br />

    Yeah, I'm a wreck without you here
    (I'm a wreck without you here, loved one)<br />
    Yeah, I'm a wreck since you been gone
    (I'm a wreck since you've been gone) <br /><br />

    I've tried to put this all behind me
    I think I was wrecked all along<br />
    (I'm a wreck)
    Yeah, I'm a wreck <br /><br />

    Sometimes, I wish
    That I could wish it all away
    (But I can't)
    One more rainy day without you <br /><br />

    Sometimes I wish that I could see you
    One more day (But I can't)
    One more rainy day`,

    lyrics: `
    Yelling at the sky
    Screaming at the world
    Baby, why'd you go away?
    I'm still your girl
    Holding on too tight
    Head up in the clouds
    Heaven only knows where you are now <br /><br />

    How do I love, how do I love again?<br />
    How do I trust, how do I trust again?<br /><br />

    I stay up all night
    Tell myself I'm alright
    Baby, you're just harder to see than most
    I put the record on
    Wait 'til I hear our song<br />
    Every night I'm dancing with your ghost<br />
    Every night I'm dancing with your ghost<br /><br />

    Never got the chance
    To say a last goodbye
    I gotta move on
    But it hurts to try<br /><br />

    How do I love, how do I love again?<br />
    How do I trust, how do I trust again?<br /><br />

    I stay up all night
    Tell myself I'm alright
    Baby, you're just harder to see than most
    I put the record on
    Wait 'til I hear our song<br />
    Every night I'm dancing with your ghost<br />
    Every night I'm dancing with your ghost<br /><br />

    How do I love, how do I love again?<br />
    How do I trust, how do I trust again?<br /><br />

    I stay up all night
    Tell myself I'm alright
    Baby, you're just harder to see than most
    I put the record on

    Every night I'm dancing with your ghost<br />
    Every night I'm dancing with your ghost<br />
